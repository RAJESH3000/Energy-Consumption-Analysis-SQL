SQL Energy Consumption Analysis

Project Overview
This project analyzes worldwide energy consumption, GDP, population, emissions, and production using **SQL**.  
It provides insights into:
- Top countries by GDP & emissions
- Year-over-year global trends
- Per-capita energy usage
- Correlation between GDP growth & energy production
- Global share of emissions by country

 Files
- **SQL_Project_final.sql** → Database schema and SQL queries
- **SQL_Project_PPT.pptx** → Project presentation with insights & recommendations

Technologies Used
- SQL (Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations)
- MySQL 

 Key Insights
- Energy and economic growth are tightly linked.
- Developed countries show efficiency improvements (lower emissions per GDP).
- Transition to renewable energy is a key differentiator.
- Policy-driven renewable adoption and energy efficiency can reduce emissions.
